Please provide a software application which calculates the final amount to be paid when given a list of books. You can and should use more than one class in your solution. Consider the longevity of the application. How would one, for example, add another discount at a later date ? You should apply best practice in your solution. You should be able to provide some guarantee that the finished product works as expected.
